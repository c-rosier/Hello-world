# Hello-world
Starting GitHub journey 
My research experience includes integrating advanced soil microbiology methods (i.e., next generation sequencing) in combination with standard soil measurements and long-term environmental monitoring. The application/collection/analysis of long-term environmental monitoring data sets provides precise, real-time insight into the dynamic nature of the soil environment allowing both informed management decisions as well as aiding the development/construction of predictive modeling efforts.
